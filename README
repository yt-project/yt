Hi there!  You've just downloaded yt, an analysis tool for 3D Enzo adaptive
mesh refinement datasets.  It's written in python and based on the NumPy and
Matplotlib components.

Full documentation is available inside doc/docs_html.zip as well as
online at http://yt.enzotools.org/ .

If you have used Python before, and are comfortable with installing packages,
you should find the setup.py script fairly straightforward.

If you would rather a more automated installation, you can use the script
doc/install_script.sh .  You will have to set the destination directory, and
there are options available, but it should be straightforward.

Please feel free to help out, and if you make any cool changes or enhancements,
let me know!  The Trac site at http://yt.enzotools.org/ has mechanisms for
ticket and problem submission, as well as an ever-growing Wiki.  I also
encourage you to sign up for the yt-users mailing list, where there is a
growing community of users ready to help out with problems and ideas!
