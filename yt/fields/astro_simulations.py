# Here's how this all works:
#
#   1. We have a mapping here that defines fields we might expect to find in an
#      astrophysical simulation to units (not necessarily definitive) that we
#      may want to use them in.
#   2. Simulations and frontends will register aliases from fields (which can
#      utilize units) to the fields enumerated here.
#   3. This plugin can call additional plugins on the registry.
