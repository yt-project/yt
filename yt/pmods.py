"""``MPI_Import`` defines an mpi-aware import hook. The standard use of
this module is as follows::

    from MPI_Import import mpi_import
    with mpi_import():
        import foo
        import bar

Within the with block, the standard import statement is replaced by an
MPI-aware import statement. The rank 0 process finds the location of
each module to import, broadcasts the location, then all of the
processes load that module.

One CRITICAL detail: any code inside the mpi_import block must be
executed exactly the same on all of the MPI ranks. For example,
consider this::

    def foo():
        import mpi
        if mpi.rank == 0:
            bar = someFunction()
        bar = mpi.bcast(bar,root=0)

    def someFunction():
        import os
        return os.name

If ``foo()`` is called during the import process, then things may go very
wrong. If the os module hasn't been loaded, then the rank 0 process
will find os and broadcast its location. Since there's no
corresponding bcast for ``rank > 0``, the other processes will receive
that broadcast instead of the broadcast for bar, resulting in
undefined behavior. Similarly, if ``rank > 0`` process encounters an import
that ``rank`` 0 does not encounter, that process will either hang waiting
for the bcast, or it will receive an out-of-order bcast.

The import hook provides a way to test whether we're using this
importer, which can be used to disable rank-asymmetric behavior in a
module import::

    import builtins
    hasattr(builtins.__import__,"mpi_import")

This evaluates to True only when we're in an ``mpi_import()`` context
manager.

There are some situations where rank-dependent code may be necessary.
One such example is pyMPI's synchronizeQueuedOutput function, which
tends to cause deadlocks when it is executed inside an mpi_imported
module. In that case, we provide a hook to execute a function after
the mpi_import hook has been replaced by the standard import hook.
Here is an example showing the use of this feature::

    # encapsulate the rank-asymmetric code in a function
    def f():
        if mpi.rank == 0:
            doOneThing()
        else:
            doSomethingElse()

    # Either importer is None (standard import) or it's a reference to
    # the mpi_import object that owns the current importer.
    import builtins
    importer = getattr(builtins.__import__,"mpi_import",None)
    if importer:
        importer.callAfterImport(f)
    else:
        # If we're using the standard import, then we'll execute the
        # code in f immediately
        f()

WARNING: the ``callAfterImport`` feature is not intended for casual use.
Usually it will be sufficient (and preferable) to either remove the
rank-asymmetric code or explicitly move it outside of the 'with
mpi_import' block. callAfterImport is provided for the (hopefully
rare!) cases where this does not suffice.

Some implementation details
---------------------------

* This code is based on knee.py, which is an example of a pure Python
  hierarchical import that was included with Python 2.6 distributions.

* Python PEP 302 defines another way to override import by using finder
  and loader objects, which behave similarly to the imp.find_module and
  imp.load_module functions in __import_module__ below. Unfortunately,
  the implementation of PEP 302 is such that the path for the module
  has already been found by the time that the "finder" object is
  constructed, so it's not suitable for our purposes.

* This module uses pyMPI. It was originally designed with mpi4py, and
  switching back to mpi4py requires only minor modifications. To
  quickly substitute mpi4py for pyMPI, the 'import mpi' line below can
  be replaced with the following wrapper::

    from mpi4py import MPI
    class mpi:
        rank = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
        @staticmethod
        def bcast(obj=None,root=0):
            return MPI.COMM_WORLD.bcast(obj,root)

* An alternate version of this module had rank 0 perform all of the
  lookups, and then broadcast the locations all-at-once when that
  process reached the end of the context manager. This was somewhat
  faster than the current implementation, but was prone to deadlock
  when loading modules containing MPI synchronization points.

* The ``level`` parameter to the import hook is not handled correctly; we
  treat it as if it were -1 (try relative and absolute imports). For
  more information about the level parameter, run ``help(__import__)``.
