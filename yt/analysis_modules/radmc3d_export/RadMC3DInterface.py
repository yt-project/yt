    This class represents an AMR "layer" of the style described in
    the radmc3d manual. Unlike yt grids, layers may not have more
    than one parent, so level L grids will need to be split up
    if they straddle two or more level L - 1 grids.

class RadMC3DWriter:
    '''

    This class provides a mechanism for writing out data files in a format
    readable by radmc3d. Currently, only the ASCII, "Layer" style file format
    is supported. For more information please see the radmc3d manual at:
    http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d

    Parameters
    ----------

    ds : `Dataset`
        This is the dataset object corresponding to the
        simulation output to be written out.

    max_level : int
        An int corresponding to the maximum number of levels of refinement
        to include in the output. Often, this does not need to be very large
        as information on very high levels is frequently unobservable.
        Default = 2.

    Examples
    --------

    This will create a field called "DustDensity" and write it out to the
    file "dust_density.inp" in a form readable by RadMC3D.

    >>> import yt
    >>> from yt.analysis_modules.radmc3d_export.api import RadMC3DWriter

    >>> dust_to_gas = 0.01
    >>> def _DustDensity(field, data):
    ...     return dust_to_gas*data["Density"]
    >>> yt.add_field("DustDensity", function=_DustDensity)

    >>> ds = yt.load("galaxy0030/galaxy0030")

    >>> writer = RadMC3DWriter(ds)
    >>> writer.write_amr_grid()
    >>> writer.write_dust_file("DustDensity", "dust_density.inp")

    ---

    This example will create a field called "NumberDensityCO" and write it out
    to the file "numberdens_co.inp". It will also write out information about
    the gas velocity to "gas_velocity.inp" so that this broadening may be
    included in the radiative transfer calculation by radmc3d:

    >>> import yt
    >>> from yt.analysis_modules.radmc3d_export.api import RadMC3DWriter

    >>> x_co = 1.0e-4
    >>> mu_h = yt.Quantity(2.34e-24, 'g')
    >>> def _NumberDensityCO(field, data):
    ...     return (x_co/mu_h)*data["Density"]
    >>> yt.add_field("NumberDensityCO", function=_NumberDensityCO)

    >>> ds = yt.load("galaxy0030/galaxy0030")
    >>> writer = RadMC3DWriter(ds)

    >>> writer.write_amr_grid()
    >>> writer.write_line_file("NumberDensityCO", "numberdens_co.inp")
    >>> velocity_fields = ["velocity_x", "velocity_y", "velocity_z"]
