    Parameters
    ----------
    msg: str
        A text message explaining that the code surrounding the call to this function is
        deprecated, and what should be changed on the user side to avoid it.

    since and removal: str version numbers, indicating the anticipated removal date

    Crucial note:
    beware that `removal` is required (it doesn't have a default value). This is
    vital since deprecated code is typically untested and not specifying a required
    keyword argument will turn the warning into a TypeError.
    What it gets us however is that the release manager will know for a fact wether it
    is safe to remove a feature at any given point, and users have a better idea when
    their code will become incompatible.

    `since` is optional only because it was introduced in the 4.0.0 release, and it
    should become mandatory in the future.
    Both `since` and `removal` are keyword-only arguments so that their order can be
    swapped in the future without introducing bugs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> issue_deprecation_warning(
            "This code is deprecated.",
            since="4.0.0",
            removal="4.2.0"
        )
    """
    msg += "\n"
    if since is not None:
        msg += f"Deprecated since v{since} . "

    msg += f"This feature will be removed in v{removal}"
    warnings.warn(msg, VisibleDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=stacklevel)
