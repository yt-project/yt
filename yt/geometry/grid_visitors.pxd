# This is similar in spirit to the way oct visitor functions work.  However,
# there are a few important differences.  Because the grid objects are expected
# to be bigger, we don't need to pass them along -- we will not be recursively
# visiting.  So the GridVisitorData will be updated in between grids.
# Furthermore, we're only going to use them for a much smaller subset of
# operations.  All child mask evaluation is going to be conducted inside the
# outermost level of the visitor function, and visitor functions will receive
# information about whether they have been selected and whether they are
# covered by child cells.
