def read_attrs(f, attrs, endian="="):
    r"""This function accepts a file pointer and reads from that file pointer
    according to a definition of attributes, returning a dictionary.

    Fortran unformatted files provide total bytesize at the beginning and end
    of a record.  By correlating the components of that record with attribute
    names, we construct a dictionary that gets returned.  Note that this
    function is used for reading sequentially-written records.  If you have
    many written that were written simultaneously, see read_record.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : File object
        An open file object.  Should have been opened in mode rb.
    attrs : iterable of iterables
        This object should be an iterable of one of the formats:
        [ (attr_name, count, struct type), ... ].
        [ ((name1,name2,name3),count, vector type]
        [ ((name1,name2,name3),count, 'type type type']
    endian : str
        '=' is native, '>' is big, '<' is little endian

    Returns
    -------
    values : dict
        This will return a dict of iterables of the components of the values in
        the file.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> header = [ ("ncpu", 1, "i"), ("nfiles", 2, "i") ]
    >>> f = open("fort.3", "rb")
    >>> rv = read_attrs(f, header)

def read_cattrs(f, attrs, endian="="):
    r"""This function accepts a file pointer to a C-binary file and reads from
    that file pointer according to a definition of attributes, returning a

    This function performs very similarly to read_attrs, except it does not add

    as in read_attrs, but for C files rather than Fortran.
