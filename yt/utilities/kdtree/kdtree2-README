             Many data-based statistical algorithms require that one find \textit{near
             or nearest neighbors} to a given vector among a set of points in that
             vector space, usually with Euclidean topology. The k-d data structure
             and search algorithms are the generalization of classical binary search
             trees to higher dimensional spaces, so that one may locate near neighbors
             to an example vector in $O(\log N)$ time instead of the brute-force
             $O(N)$ time, with $N$ being the size of the data base. KDTREE2 is
             a Fortran 95 module, and a parallel set of C++ classes which implement
             tree construction and search routines to find either a set of $m$
             nearest neighbors to an example, or all the neighbors within some
             Euclidean distance $r.$ The two versions are independent and function
             fully on their own. Considerable care has been taken in the implementation
             of the search methods, resulting in substantially higher computational
             efficiency (up to an order of magnitude faster) than the author's
             previous Internet-distributed version. Architectural improvements
             include rearrangement for memory cache-friendly performance, heap-based
             priority queues for large $m$searches, and more effective pruning
             of search paths by geometrical constraints to avoid wasted effort.
             The improvements are the most potent in the more difficult and slowest
             cases: larger data base sizes, higher dimensionality manifolds containing
             the data set, and larger numbers of neighbors to search for. The C++
             implementation requires the Standard Template Library as well as the
             BOOST C++ library be installed.
