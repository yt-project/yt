    Load sample data with yt. Simple wrapper around yt.load to include fetching

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str or None
        The name of the sample data to load. This is generally the name of the
        folder of the dataset. For IsolatedGalaxy, the name would be
        `IsolatedGalaxy`.  If `None` is supplied, the return value
        will be a list of all known datasets (by name).

    specific_file : str, optional
        optional argument -- the name of the file to load that is located
        within sample dataset of `name`. For the dataset `enzo_cosmology_plus`,
        which has a number of timesteps available, one may wish to choose
        DD0003. The file specifically would be
        `enzo_cosmology_plus/DD0003/DD0003`, and the argument passed to this
