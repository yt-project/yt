You can download these datasets at https://yt-project.org/data/, or you can use the built-in yt sample data loader (using [pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/api/index.html) under the hood) to automatically download the data for you.\n",

    "## Using the Automatic Downloader\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this tutorial, or whenever you want to use sample data, you can use the `load_sample` command to utilize the pooch auto-downloader.  For instance:\n",
