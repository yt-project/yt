    "# Loading Data via Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that yt provides is the notion of \"derived fields.\"  These are fields that exist only in memory, and are defined by a functional form, typically transforming other fields.  Starting with version 4.1 of yt, however, we have made it much, much easier to define so-called \"on-disk\" fields through their functional forms, akin to how derived fields are generated.  **At present, this is only available for grid-based frontends.  Extension to other types is anticipated in future versions of yt.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that if you have a way to grab data -- at any resolution -- but don't want to either load it into memory in advance or write a complete \"frontend\", you can just write some functions and use those to construct a fully-functional dataset using the existing `load_amr_grids` and `load_uniform_grid` functions, supplying *functions* instead of arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few immediate use cases that can be seen for this:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data is accessible through another library, for instance if a library exists that reads subsets of data (or regularizes that data to given regions) or if you are calling yt from an *in situ* analysis library\n",
    " - Data can be remotely accessed on-demand\n",
    " - You have a straightforward data format for which a frontend does not exist\n",
    " - All of the data can be generated through an analytical definition\n",
    " \n",
    "The last one is what we'll use to demonstrate this.  Let's imagine that I had a grid structure that I wanted to explore, but I wanted all of my data to be generated through functions that were exclusively dependent on the spatial position."
