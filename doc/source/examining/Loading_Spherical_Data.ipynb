    "With version 3.0 of yt, it has gained the ability to load data from non-Cartesian systems.  This support is still being extended, but here is an example of how to load spherical data from a regularly-spaced grid.  For irregularly spaced grids, a similar setup can be used, but the `load_hexahedral_mesh` method will have to be used instead.\n",
