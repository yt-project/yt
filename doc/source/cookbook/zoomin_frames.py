# What we do now is a bit fun.  "enumerate" returns a tuple for every item --
# the index of the item, and the item itself.  This saves us having to write
# something like "i = 0" and then inside the loop "i += 1" for ever loop.  The
# argument to enumerate is the 'logspace' function, which takes a minimum and a
# maximum and the number of items to generate.  It returns 10^power of each
# item it generates.
