What is yt?
-----------

yt is a toolkit for analyzing and visualizing quantitative data.  Originally
written to analyze 3D grid-based astrophysical simulation data,
it has grown to handle any kind of data represented in a 2D or 3D volume.
yt is an Python-based open source project and is open for anyone to use or
contribute code.  The entire source code and history is available to all
at https://github.com/yt-project/yt .

Who is yt?
----------

As an open-source project, yt has a large number of user-developers.
In September of 2014, the yt developer community collectively decided to endow
the title of *member* on individuals who had contributed in a significant way
to the project.  For a list of those members and a description of their
contributions to the code, see
`our members website. <https://yt-project.org/members.html>`_

For an up-to-date list of everyone who has contributed to the yt codebase,
see the current `CREDITS <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/blob/master/CREDITS>`_ file.
For a more detailed breakup of contributions made by individual users, see out
`Open HUB page <https://www.openhub.net/p/yt_amr/contributors?query=&sort=commits>`_.

History of yt
-------------

yt was originally begun by Matthew Turk in 2007 in the course of his graduate
studies in computational astrophysics.  The code was developed
as a simple data-reader and exporter for grid-based hydrodynamical simulation
data outputs from the *Enzo* code.  Over the next few years, he invited
collaborators and friends to contribute and use yt.  As the community grew,
so did the capabilities of yt.  It is now a community-developed project with
contributions from many people, the hospitality of several institutions, and
benefiting from numerous grants.  With this community-driven approach
and contributions from a sizeable population of developers, it has evolved
into a fully-featured toolkit for analysis and visualization of
multidimensional data.  It relies on no proprietary software -- although it
can be and has been extended to interface with proprietary software and
libraries -- and has been designed from the ground up to enable users to be
as immersed in the data as they desire.

How do I contact yt?
