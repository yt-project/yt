Version 3.5.0
-------------

Version 3.5.0 is the first major release of yt since August 2017. It includes
328 pull requests from 41 contributors, including 22 new contributors.

Major Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``yt.analysis_modules`` has been deprecated in favor of the new
  ``yt_astro_analysis`` package. New features and new astronomy-specific
  analysis modules will go into ``yt_astro_analysis`` and importing from
  ``yt.analysis_modules`` will raise a noisy warning. We will remove
  ``yt.analysis_modules`` in a future release. See `PR 1938
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1938>`__.
- Vector fields and derived fields depending on vector fields have been
  systematically updated to account for a bulk correction field parameter. For
  example, for the velocity field, all derived fields that depend on velocity
  will now account for the ``"bulk_velocity"`` field parameter. In addition, we
  have defined ``"relative_velocity"`` and ``"relative_magnetic_field"`` fields
  that include the bulk correction. Both of these are vector fields, to access
  the components, use e.g. ``"relative_velocity_x"``. The
  ``"particle_position_relative"`` and ``"particle_velocity_relative"`` fields
  have been deprecated. See `PR 1693
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1693>`__ and `PR 2022
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/2022>`__.
- Aliases to spatial fields with the ``"gas"`` field type will now be returned
  in the default unit system for the dataset. As an example the ``"x"`` field
  might resolve to the field tuples ``("index", "x")`` or ``("gas",
  "x")``. Accessing the former will return data in code units while the latter
  will return data in whatever unit system the dataset is configured to use
  (CGS, by default). This means that to ensure the units of a spatial field will
  always be consistent, one must access the field as a tuple, explicitly
  specifying the field type. Accessing a spatial field using a string field name
  may return data in either code units or the dataset's default unit system
  depending on the history of field accesses prior to accessing that field. In
  the future accessing fields using an ambiguous field name will raise an
  error. See `PR 1799 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1799>`__ and `PR
  1850 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1850>`__.
- The ``max_level`` and ``min_level`` attributes of yt data objects now
  correctly update the state of the underlying data objects when set. In
  addition we have added an example to the cookbook that shows how to downsample
  AMR data using this functionality. See `PR 1737
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1737>`__.
- It is now possible to customize the formatting of labels for ion species
  fields. Rather than using the default spectroscopic notation, one can call
  ``ds.set_field_label_format("ionization_label", "plus_minus")`` to use the
  more traditional notation where ionization state is indicated with ``+`` and
  ``-`` symbols. See `PR 1867 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1867>`__.

Improvements to the RAMSES frontend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We would particularly like to recognize Corentin Cadiou for his tireless work over the past year on improving support for RAMSES and octree AMR data in yt.

- Added support for reading RAMSES sink particles. See `PR 1548
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1548>`__.
- Add support for the new self-describing Ramses particle output format. See `PR
  1616 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1616>`__.
- It is now possible to restrict the domain of a loaded Ramses dataset by
  passing a ``bbox`` keyword argument to ``yt.load()``. If passed this
  corresponds to the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right hand corner of
  the subvolume to load. Data outside the bounding box will be ignored. This is
  useful for loading very large Ramses datasets where yt currently has poor
  scaling. See `PR 1637 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1637>`__.
- The Ramses ``"particle_birth_time"`` field now contains the time when star
  particles form in a simulation in CGS units, formerly these times were only
  accessible via the incorrectly named ``"particle_age"`` field in conformal
  units. Correspondingly the ``"particle_age"`` field has been deprecated. The
  conformal birth time is not available via the ``"conformal_birth_time``"
  field. See `PR 1649 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1649>`__.
- Substantial performance improvement for reading RAMSES AMR data. See `PR 1671
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1671>`__.
- The RAMSES frontend will now produce less voluminous logging feedback when
  loading the dataset or reading data. This is particularly noticeable for very
  large datasets with many CPU files. See `PR 1738
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1738>`__.
- Avoid repeated parsing of RAMSES particle and RT descriptors. See `PR 1739
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1739>`__.
- Added support for reading the RAMSES gravitational potential field. See `PR
  1751 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1751>`__.
- Add support for RAMSES datasets that use the ``groupsize`` feature. See `PR
  1769 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1769>`__.
- Dramatically improve the overall performance of the RAMSES frontend. See `PR
  1771 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1771>`__.

Additional Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for particle data in the Enzo-E frontend. See `PR 1490
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1490>`__.
- Added an ``equivalence`` keyword argument to ``YTArray.in_units()`` and
  ``YTArray.to()``. This makes it possible to specify an equivalence when
  converting data to a new unit. Also added ``YTArray.to_value()`` which allows
  converting to a new unit, then stripping off the units to return a plain numpy
  array. See `PR 1563 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1563>`__.
- Rather than crashing, yt will now assume default values for cosmology
  parameters in Gadget HDF5 data if it cannot find the relevant header
  information. See `PR 1578
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1578>`__.
- Improve detection for OpenMP support at compile-time, including adding support
  for detecting OpenMP on Windows. See `PR 1591
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1591>`__, `PR 1695
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1695>`__ and `PR 1696
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1696>`__.
- Add support for 2D cylindrical data for most plot callbacks. See `PR 1598
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1598>`__.
- Particles outside the domain are now ignored by ``load_uniform_grid()`` and
  ``load_amr_grids()``. See `PR 1602
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1602>`__.
- Fix incorrect units for the Gadget internal energy field in cosmology
  simulations. See `PR 1611
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1611>`__.
- Add support for calculating covering grids in parallel. See `PR 1612
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1612>`__.
- The number of particles in a dataset loaded by the stream frontend (e.g. via
  ``load_uniform_grid``) no longer needs to be explicitly provided via the
  ``number_of_particles`` keyword argument, using the ``number_of_particles``
  keyword will now generate a deprecation warning. See `PR 1620
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1620>`__.
- Add support for non-cartesian GAMER data. See `PR 1622
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1622>`__.
- If a particle filter depends on another particle filter, both particle filters
  will be registered for a dataset if the dependent particle filter is
  registered with a dataset. See `PR 1624
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1624>`__.
- The ``save()`` method of the various yt plot objects now optionally can accept
  a tuple of strings instead of a string. If a tuple is supplied, the elements
  are joined with ``os.sep`` to form a path. See `PR 1630
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1630>`__.
- The quiver callback now accepts a ``plot_args`` keyword argument that allows
  passing keyword arguments to matplotlib to allow for customization of the
  quiver plot. See `PR 1636 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1636>`__.
- Updates and improvements for the OpenPMD frontend. See `PR 1645
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1645>`__.
- The mapserver now works correctly under Python3 and has new features like a
  colormap selector and plotting multiple fields via layers. See `PR 1654
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1654>`__ and `PR 1668
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1668>`__.
- Substantial performance improvement for calculating the gravitational
  potential in the clump finder. See `PR 1684
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1684>`__.
- Added new methods to ``ProfilePlot``: ``set_xlabel()``, ``set_ylabel()``,
  ``annotate_title()``, and ``annotate_text()``. See `PR 1700
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1700>`__ and `PR 1705
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1705>`__.
- Speedup for parallel halo finding operation for the FOF and HOP halo
  finders. See `PR 1724 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1724>`__.
- Add support for halo finding using the rockstar halo finder on Python3. See
  `PR 1740 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1740>`__.
- The ``ValidateParameter`` field validator has gained the ability for users to
  explicitly specify the values of field parameters during field detection. This
  makes it possible to write fields that access different sets of fields
  depending on the value of the field parameter. For example, a field might
  define an ``'axis'`` field parameter that can be either ``'x'``, ``'y'`` or
  ``'z'``. One can now explicitly tell the field detection system to access the
  field using all three values of ``'axis'``. This improvement avoids errors one
  would see now where only one value or an invalid value of the field parameter
  will be tested by yt. See `PR 1741
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1741>`__.
- It is now legal to pass a dataset instance as the first argument to
  ``ProfilePlot`` and ``PhasePlot``. This is equivalent to passing
  ``ds.all_data()``.
- Functions that accept a ``(length, unit)`` tuple (e.g. ``(3, 'km')`` for 3
  kilometers) will not raise an error if ``length`` is a ``YTQuantity`` instance
  with units attached. See `PR 1749
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1749>`__.
- The ``annotate_timestamp`` plot annotation now optionally accepts a
  ``time_offset`` keyword argument that sets the zero point of the time
  scale. Additionally, the ``annotate_scale`` plot annotation now accepts a
  ``format`` keyword argument, allowing custom formatting of the scale
  annotation. See `PR 1755 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1755>`__.
- Add support for magnetic field variables and creation time fields in the GIZMO
  frontend. See `PR 1756 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1756>`__ and `PR
  1914 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1914>`__.
- ``ParticleProjectionPlot`` now supports the ``annotate_particles`` plot
  callback. See `PR 1765 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1765>`__.
- Optimized the performance of off-axis projections for octree AMR data. See `PR
  1766 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1766>`__.
- Added support for several radiative transfer fields in the ARTIO frontend. See
  `PR 1804 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1804>`__.
- Performance improvement for Boxlib datasets that don't use AMR. See `PR 1834
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1834>`__.
- It is now possible to set custom profile bin edges. See `PR 1837
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1837>`__.
- Dropped support for Python3.4. See `PR 1840
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1840>`__.
- Add support for reading RAMSES cooling fields. See `PR 1853
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1853>`__.
- Add support for NumPy 1.15. See `PR 1854
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1854>`__.
- Ensure that functions defined in the plugins file are available in the yt
  namespace. See `PR 1855 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1855>`__.
- Creating a profiles with log-scaled bins but where the bin edges are negative
  or zero now raises an error instead of silently generating a corrupt,
  incorrect answer. See `PR 1856
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1856>`__.
- Systematically added validation for inputs to data object initializers. See
  `PR 1871 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1871>`__.
- It is now possible to select only a specific particle type in the particle
  trajectories analysis module. See `PR 1887
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1887>`__.
- Substantially improve the performance of selecting particle fields with a
  ``cut_region`` data object. See `PR 1892
  <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1892>`__.
- The ``iyt`` command-line entry-point into IPython now installs yt-specific
  tab-completions. See `PR 1900 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1900>`__.
- Derived quantities have been systematically updated to accept a
  ``particle_type`` keyword argument, allowing easier analysis of only a single
  particle type. See `PR 1902 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1902>`__
  and `PR 1922 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1922>`__.
- The ``annotate_streamlines()`` function now accepts a ``display_threshold``
  keyword argument. This suppresses drawing streamlines over any region of a

Version 3.4
-----------

Version 3.4 is the first major release of yt since July 2016. It includes 450
pull requests from 44 contributors including 18 new contributors.

-  yt now supports displaying plots using the interactive matplotlib
   backends. To enable this functionality call
   ``yt.toggle_interactivity()``. This is currently supported at an
   experimental level, please let us know if you come across issues
   using it. See `Bitbucket PR
   2294 <https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2294>`__.
-  The yt configuration file should now be located in a location
   following the XDG\_CONFIG convention (usually ``~/.config/yt/ytrc``)
   rather than the old default location (usually ``~/.yt/config``). You
   can use ``yt config migrate`` at the bash command line to migrate
   your configuration file to the new location. See `Bitbucket PR
   2343 <https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2343>`__.
-  Added ``yt.LinePlot``, a new plotting class for creating 1D plots
   along lines through a dataset. See `Github PR
   1509 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1509>`__ and `Github PR
   1440 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1440>`__.
-  Added ``yt.define_unit`` to easily define new units in yt's unit
   system. See `Bitbucket PR
   2485 <https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2485>`__.
-  Added ``yt.plot_2d``, a wrapper around SlicePlot for plotting 2D
   datasets. See `Github PR
   1476 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1476>`__.
-  We have restored support for boolean data objects. Boolean objects
   are data objects that are defined in terms of boolean operations on
   other data objects. See `Bitbucket PR
   2257 <https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2257>`__.
-  Datasets now have a ``fields`` attribute that allows access to fields
   via a python object. For example, instead of using a tuple field name
   like ``('gas', 'density')``, one can now use
   ``ds.fields.gas.density``. See `Bitbucket PR
   2459 <https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2459>`__.
-  It is now possible to create a wider variety of data objects via
   ``ds.r``, including rays, fixed resolution rays, points, and images.
   See `Github PR 1518 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1518>`__
   and `Github PR 1393 <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1393>`__.
-  ``add_field`` and ``ds.add_field`` must now be called with a
   ``sampling_type`` keyword argument. Possible values are currently
   ``cell`` and ``particle``. We have also deprecated the
   ``particle_type`` keyword argument in favor of
   ``sampling_type='cell'``. For now a ``'cell'`` ``sampling_type`` is
   assumed if ``sampling_type`` is not specified but in the future
   ``sampling_type`` will always need to be specified.
-  Added support for the ``Athena++`` code. See `Bitbucket PR
   2149 <https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2149>`__.
-  Added support for the ``Enzo-E`` code. See `Github PR

-  A number of untested and unmaintained modules have been deprecated
   and moved to the `yt attic
   repository <https://github.com/yt-project/yt_attic>`__. This includes
   the functionality for calculating two point functions, the Sunrise
   exporter, the star analysis module, and the functionality for
   calculating halo mass functions. If you are interested in working on
   restoring the functionality in these modules, we welcome
   contributions. Please contact us on the mailing list or by opening an
   issue on GitHub if you have questions.
-  The particle trajectories functionality has been removed from the
   analysis modules API and added as a method of the ``DatasetSeries``
   object. You can now create a ``ParticleTrajectories`` object using
   ``ts.particle_trajectories()`` where ``ts`` is a time series of
   datasets.

Version 3.0
-----------

This release of yt features an entirely rewritten infrastructure for
data ingestion, indexing, and representation.  While past versions of
yt were focused on analysis and visualization of data structured as
regular grids, this release features full support for particle
(discrete point) data such as N-body and SPH data, irregular
hexahedral mesh data, and data organized via octrees.  This
infrastructure will be extended in future versions for high-fidelity
representation of unstructured mesh datasets.

Highlighted changes in yt 3.0:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Units now permeate the code base, enabling self-consistent unit
   transformations of all arrays and quantities returned by yt.
 * Particle data is now supported using a lightweight octree.  SPH
   data can be smoothed onto an adaptively-defined mesh using standard
   SPH smoothing
 * Support for octree AMR codes
 * Preliminary Support for non-Cartesian data, such as cylindrical,
   spherical, and geographical
 * Revamped analysis framework for halos and halo catalogs, including
   direct ingestion and analysis of halo catalogs of several different
   formats
 * Support for multi-fluid datasets and datasets containing multiple
   particle types
 * Flexible support for dynamically defining new particle types using
   filters on existing particle types or by combining different particle
   types.
 * Vastly improved support for loading generic grid, AMR, hexahedral
   mesh, and particle without hand-coding a frontend for a particular
   data format.
 * New frontends for ART, ARTIO, Boxlib, Chombo, FITS, GDF, Subfind,
   Rockstar, Pluto, RAMSES, SDF, Gadget, OWLS, PyNE, Tipsy, as well as
   rewritten frontends for Enzo, FLASH, Athena, and generic data.
 * First release to support installation of yt on Windows
 * Extended capabilities for construction of simulated observations,
   and new facilities for analyzing and visualizing FITS images and cube
   data
 * Many performance improvements

This release is the first of several; while most functionality from
the previous generation of yt has been updated to work with yt 3.0, it
does not yet have feature parity in all respects.  While the core of
yt is stable, we suggest the support for analysis modules and volume
rendering be viewed as a late-stage beta, with a series of additional
releases (3.1, 3.2, etc) appearing over the course of the next year to
improve support in these areas.

For a description of how to bring your 2.x scripts up to date to 3.0,
and a summary of common gotchas in this transition, please see
:ref:`yt3differences`.

Version 2.5
-----------

Many below-the-surface changes happened in yt 2.5 to improve reliability,
fidelity of the answers, and streamlined user interface.  The major change in
this release has been the immense expansion in testing of yt.  We now have over
2000 unit tests (run on every commit, thanks to both Kacper Kowalik and Shining
Panda) as well as answer testing for FLASH, Enzo, Chombo and Orion data.

The Stream frontend, which can construct datasets in memory, has been improved
considerably.  It's now easier than ever to load data from disk.  If you know
how to get volumetric data into Python, you can use either the
``load_uniform_grid`` function or the ``load_amr_grid`` function to create an
in-memory dataset that yt can analyze.

yt now supports the Athena code.

yt is now focusing on providing first class support for the IPython notebook.
In this release, plots can be displayed inline.  The Reason HTML5 GUI will be
merged with the IPython notebook in a future release.

Install Script Changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * SciPy can now be installed
 * Rockstar can now be installed
 * Dependencies can be updated with "yt update --all"
 * Cython has been upgraded to 0.17.1
 * Python has been upgraded to 2.7.3
 * h5py has been upgraded to 2.1.0
 * hdf5 has been upgraded to 1.8.9
 * matplotlib has been upgraded to 1.2.0
 * IPython has been upgraded to 0.13.1
 * Forthon has been upgraded to 0.8.10
 * nose has been added
 * sympy has been added
 * python-hglib has been added

We've also improved support for installing on OSX, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE.

Most Visible Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Nearly 200 pull requests and over 1000 changesets have been merged since yt
   2.4 was release on August 2nd, 2012.
 * numpy is now imported as np, not na.  na will continue to work for the
   foreseeable future.
 * You can now get a `yt cheat sheet <http://yt-project.org/docs/2.5/cheatsheet.pdf>`_!
 * yt can now load simulation data created by Athena.
 * The Rockstar halo finder can now be installed by the install script
 * SciPy can now be installed by the install script
 * Data can now be written out in two ways:

   * Sidecar files containing expensive derived fields can be written and
     implicitly loaded from.
   * GDF files, which are portable yt-specific representations of full
     simulations, can be created from any dataset.  Work is underway on
     a pure C library that can be linked against to load these files into
     simulations.

 * The "Stream" frontend, for loading raw data in memory, has been greatly
   expanded and now includes initial conditions generation functionality,
   particle fields, and simple loading of AMR grids with ``load_amr_grids``.
 * Spherical and Cylindrical fields have been sped up and made to have a
   uniform interface.  These fields can be the building blocks of more advanced
   fields.
 * Coordinate transformations have been sped up and streamlined. It is now
   possible to convert any scalar or vector field to a new cartesian, spherical,
   or cylindrical coordinate system with an arbitrary orientation. This makes it
   possible to do novel analyses like profiling the toroidal and poloidal
   velocity as a function of radius in an inclined disk.
 * Many improvements to the EnzoSimulation class, which can now find many
   different types of data.
 * Image data is now encapsulated in an ImageArray class, which carries with it
   provenance information about its trajectory through yt.
 * Streamlines now query at every step along the streamline, not just at every
   cell.
 * Surfaces can now be extracted and examined, as well as uploaded to
   Sketchfab.com for interactive visualization in a web browser.
 * allsky_projection can now accept a datasource, making it easier to cut out
   regions to examine.
 * Many, many improvements to PlotWindow.  If you're still using
   PlotCollection, check out ``ProjectionPlot``, ``SlicePlot``,
   ``OffAxisProjectionPlot`` and ``OffAxisSlicePlot``.
 * PlotWindow can now accept a timeseries instead of a dataset.
 * Many fixes for 1D and 2D data, especially in FLASH datasets.
 * Vast improvements to the particle file handling for FLASH datasets.
 * Particles can now be created ex nihilo with CICSample_3.
 * Rockstar halo finding is now a targeted goal.  Support for using Rockstar
   has improved dramatically.
 * Increased support for tracking halos across time using the FOF halo finder.
 * The command ``yt notebook`` has been added to spawn an IPython notebook
   server, and the ``yt.imods`` module can replace ``yt.mods`` in the IPython
   Notebook to enable better integration.
 * Metallicity-dependent X-ray fields have now been added.
 * Grid lines can now be added to volume renderings.
 * Volume rendering backend has been updated to use an alpha channel, fixing
   parallel opaque volume renderings.  This also enables easier blending of
   multiple images and annotations to the rendering. Users are encouraged
   to look at the capabilities of the ``ImageArray`` for writing out renders,
   as updated in the cookbook examples. Volume renders can now be saved with
   an arbitrary background color.
 * Periodicity, or alternately non-periodicity, is now a part of radius
   calculations.
 * The AMRKDTree has been rewritten.  This allows parallelism with other than
   power-of-2 MPI processes, arbitrary sets of grids, and splitting of
   unigrids.
 * Fixed Resolution Buffers and volume rendering images now utilize a new
   ImageArray class that stores information such as data source, field names,
   and other information in a .info dictionary. See the ``ImageArray``
   docstrings for more information on how they can be used to save to a bitmap
   or hdf5 file.

Version 2.4
-----------

The 2.4 release was particularly large, encompassing nearly a thousand
changesets and a number of new features.

To help you get up to speed, we've made an IPython notebook file demonstrating
