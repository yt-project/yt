Developing in yt
================

yt is an open-source project with a community of contributing scientists.
While you can use the existing framework within yt to help answer questions
about your own datasets, yt thrives by the addition of new functionality by
users just like yourself.  Maybe you have a new data format that you would like
supported, a new derived quantity that you feel should be included, or a new
way of visualizing data--please add them to the code base!  We are eager to
help you make it happen.

There are many ways to get involved with yt -- participating in the mailing
list, helping people out in IRC, providing suggestions for the documentation,
and contributing code!
