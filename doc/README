This directory contains the uncompiled yt documentation.  It's written to be
used with Sphinx, a tool designed for writing Python documentation.  Sphinx is
available at this URL:

http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

Because the documentation requires a number of dependencies, we provide
pre-built versions online, accessible here:

https://yt-project.org/docs/dev/
