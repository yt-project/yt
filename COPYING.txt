About the yt Development Team
-----------------------------

Matthew Turk began yt in 2006 and remains the project lead.  Over time yt has
grown to include contributions from a large number of individuals from many
diverse institutions, scientific, and technical backgrounds.

Until the fall of 2013, yt was licensed under the GPLv3.  However, with consent
from all developers and on a public mailing list, yt has been relicensed under
the BSD 3-clause under a shared copyright model.  For more information, see:
https://mail.python.org/archives/list/yt-dev@python.org/thread/G4DJDDGB4PSZFJVPWRSHNOSUMTISXC4X/
All versions of yt prior to this licensing change are available under the
GPLv3; all subsequent versions are available under the BSD 3-clause license.

The yt Development Team is the set of all contributors to the yt project.  This
includes all of the yt subprojects.

The core team that coordinates development on BitBucket can be found here:

Our Copyright Policy
--------------------

yt uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to yt. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the yt
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire yt
Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the yt repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) 2013, yt Development Team.
#
# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.
#
# The full license is in the file COPYING.txt, distributed with this software.
