@pytest.fixture(scope="class")
def answer_file(request):
    r"""
    Assigns the name of the appropriate answer file as an attribute of
    the calling answer test class.

    The answer file is the file that either already contains previously
    generated answers or else is going to contain newly generated
    answers. If an answer file already exists, then it cannot be used
    to hold newly generated answers; a fresh file must be used instead.

    Each class that performs answer tests (e.g., TestEnzo) has a
    corresponding answer file. These answer files are stored in
    test_data_dir/answers. The names of the files and their
    corresponding answer class are in ./tests/tests.yaml.

    Parameters:
    -----------
        request : pytest.FixtureRequest
            Provides access to the requesting test context. For
            example, if an answer class uses this fixture, such as
            TestEnzo, then request provides access to all of the
            methods and attributes of the TestEnzo class, since
            that class is the user of this fixture (the calling
            context).

    Example:
    --------
        # This fixture should be used whenever a new answer class is
        # defined
        >>> @pytest.mark.usefixtures('answer_file')
        >>> class TestNewFrontend:

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def hashing(request):
    r"""
    Handles initialization, generation, and saving of answer test
    result hashes.

    Answer tests that require generated data to be saved to disk
    have that data hashed. This fixture creates an empty dictionary
    as an attribute of the answer class of which the current answer
    test is a method.

    Once the test has been run and the raw data has been saved to this
    hashes dictionary, this fixture hashes the raw data and prepares
    an entry to the answer file containing the test name as well as the
    test parameter names and values to accompany the hash(es).

    These entries are then either compared to an existing entry or
    saved in the new answer file.

    Parameters:
    -----------
        request : pytest.FixtureRequest
            Provides access to the requesting test context. For
            example, if an answer class uses this fixture, such as
            TestEnzo, then request provides access to all of the
            methods and attributes of the TestEnzo class, since
            that class is the user of this fixture (the calling
            context).

    Example:
    --------
        # If every method of an answer class saves data then the
        # fixture can be applied to each method like so:
        >>> @pytest.mark.usefixtures('hashing')
        >>> class TestNewFrontend:
        >>>     def test1(self):
        >>>         ...
        >>>     def test2(self):
        >>>         ...
        # If only certain methods save data, then it must be applied
        # directly to those methods, like so:
        >>> class TestNewFrontend:
        >>>     @pytest.mark.usefixtures('hashing')
        >>>     def test1(self):
